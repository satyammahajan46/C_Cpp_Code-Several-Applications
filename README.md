## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/satyammahajan46/C-Cpp-Code-Several_applications.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd C-Cpp-Code-Several_applications`

## Usage

### Matrix Multiplication
1. Navigate to the `matrix-multiplication` directory: `cd matrix-multiplication`
2. Compile the C++ code: `g++ matrix_multiplication.cpp -o matrix_multiplication`
3. Run the application: `./matrix_multiplication`
4. The program will prompt you to enter the dimensions of two matrices and their elements. It will then perform the matrix multiplication and display the result.

### Path Finder in Matrix
1. Navigate to the `path-finder` directory: `cd path-finder`
2. Compile the C++ code: `g++ path_finder.cpp -o path_finder`
3. Run the application: `./path_finder`
4. The program will read a matrix from the `input.txt` file and find the shortest path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. It will display the path and the minimum cost.

### Queue Database
1. Navigate to the `queue-database` directory: `cd queue-database`
2. Compile the C++ code: `g++ queue_database.cpp -o queue_database`
3. Run the application: `./queue_database`
4. The program demonstrates a simple implementation of a queue data structure using an array. It allows you to perform basic queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and display the queue.
